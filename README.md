# GeoDataObserverPattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object, called the subject, to maintain a list of its dependents, called observers, and notify them automatically of any state changes. 

Qt is a popular framework for building graphical user interfaces, provides support for implementing the Observer pattern through its signals and slots mechanism.
